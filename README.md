## 🩵 Hi there! I'm Nynke (She/Her)
I'm an Electrical Engineering student with a background in Mechatronics, with a growing interest in IT and Computer Science.
Throughout my studies, I’ve worked on various programming projects, including developing a line-tracking robot using MicroPython and setting up a private network with a custom VoIP service.
In my free time, I enjoy customizing my Linux setup and creating scripts to streamline everyday tasks.

## 🩷 My experience
A short summation of the languages I've used.\
Python, Kotlin, C & C++, Shell, ST (PLC), HTML & CSS

## 🩵 Miscellaneous
My interest in programming started when I first worked with a PLC—I was fascinated by how a small piece of code could control an entire production line.
Since I didn’t have a factory at home, I began experimenting by building a Discord bot.
Now, as an Electrical Engineering student, I have even more opportunities to apply my skills and expand my knowledge.
